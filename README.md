# Cuprum
A decentralized, free game marketplace where developers are paid for their contributions to the network.

## Concept
Cuprum is a network of nodes that together create a marketplace of free, open-source games.
The network runs on the $ENT (entertainment) Solana token, 
empowering users to support their favorite games and developers, stake in the platform, and earn dividends from successful projects.

## How it works
Cuprum uses two-week periods called **cycles** to syncronize payouts and rankings.
There are 3 main actions that take place during cycles:
- Accquiring games
- Staking in games
- Staking in the platform
There are 2 actions that take place at the end of cycles:
- Delivering payouts to game stakers and developers
- Delivering payouts to platform stakers and node operators
- Reordering the rankings
These actions are processed by decentralized nodes that validate and secure each transaction.

### Accquiring and Playing Games
All games on the Cuprum network are free to download. 
Games may include in-app purchases usally made in $ENT or a fiat currency.

### Staking in Games and the platform
Stakers can invest in games to earn dividends in the game's payout.
They can also invest in the platform itself to earn more $ENT at the end of the cycle.

### Payouts
Around 30% of circulating $ENT is kept in reserve by the network. That reserve is split into 4 parts:
- Core Pool: 60%
- Platform Staker Reward Pool: 10%
- Node Operator Reward Pool: 10%
- Developer/Game Staker Reward Pool: 20%
#### Core Pool
This pool is created to help stop token inflation and ensure $ENT maintains it's value.
#### Platform Staker Pool
Stakers are paid proportional to the amount staked.
Staked currency is distrubted to the node operator pool and the game staker pool.

## Network
Cuprum nodes are responsible for validating transactions and securing the network.
Nodes are rewarded with $ENT for their work.
The network uses a hybrid PoH/PoA/PoS consensus mechanism to ensure security and decentralization.
### Consensus
Nodes reach consensus through a hybrid Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake mechanism. 
Transactions are timestamped and ordered by a Proof of History mechanism.
They are then validated through nodes selected via a Proof of Stake mechanism.
### Governance
We also use a DAO governance system to allow the community to vote on changes to the network.
